          <p>
            Context: This clock has switch-like behavior where you can toggle between counting the time that you are productive,
            switching when you want a break on your phone.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This clock is mainly for students who have study sessions. This is to see how 
            how much time they actually are productive during their sessions, vs. being on their phone and being distracted from
          their true tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> I made sure that the switch were different colors on each side to help differentiate between the toggles.
            For a UX perspective, I added an option for the user to reset if they wanted to start over more easily. I made the break time red to symbolize
          that it's not supposed to be what you are doing. </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> Collect data from multiple resets and sessions to product a summary of your stats for the day or week.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <figcaption>I originally modeled this drawing after the clocks that are used in chess competitions. 
            I really liked the switch toggle function, and wanted to bring this into a student perspective. </figcaption>

      <h3 id="sk2-narrative-title"> Personal Record Clock</h3>
      <p>
        Context: This clock starts at 15 seconds and is meant for short form sprinting. If you beat the 15 seconds, you set a new personal record, and the 
        time resets to that personal record. If you exceed the time, the results at the end tells you how many seconds you were off from beating it.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Context:</strong> This clock is for runners who want to refine their short sprint runs. For example, 40 yard dash times.</li>
        <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> I added a progress bar to show visualize how close they are to beating the personal record. I also made sure to specify
        the time to beat, and the seconds exceeded if you didn't break the record. This is because I know collecting data and documentation is super important
        to help refine your runs.
       </li>
        <li><strong>Future work:</strong> Find a way to produce a list of record progression, from times exceeded and times broken.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <img src="/Users/ryanlouie/Documents/Screenshot 2026-02-07 at 11.23.03 AM.png" alt="Sketch #A" />
      <figcaption>I originally drew this as a stop watch format because it made it intuitive on what its use is. However 
      I chose to keep it in a more simple format because the documentation and functionality I concluded was more important than
      the exterior design.

      <h3 id="sk2-narrative-title"> Water Drank Clock</h3>
      <p>
        Context: This clock has multiple layers. It shows a regular analog clock and has a blue ring around it show the quantity of water
        you should drink at that corresponding time.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Context:</strong> This clock is for anyone that wants to keep track of their water intake, mostly people watching their health and lifestyle.</li>
        <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> I made sure that the ring around the clock was blue so that it is intuitive to know that it
        represented water. I also made the text to show the water quantity was also blue so you can see that it is connected. This is contrasted
      with the clock that has standard black, white, and red colors to seperate the two measurements (water and time). </li>
        <li><strong>Future work:</strong> There are some formatting issues like the title being overlapped which can be edited. Also making the ring of blue more interactive.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/Users/ryanlouie/Documents/Screenshot 2026-02-07 at 11.22.43 AM.png" alt="Sketch #C" />
      <figcaption>I made the clock relatively thick to represent the water, but chose a thinner design for future iterations. 
        This is because I thought that there was going to be too much distraction from the time. I kept everything relatively the same. </figcaption>
